# A Robust Zero-watermark Method Based on Deep Learning and Chaotic Permutation 
This paper introduces a robust deep learning method with chaotic permutation for zero-watermarking construction. This method first extracts semantic features based on deep learning and performs permutation encryption through chaotic sequences to generate zero watermark images with high robustness.
